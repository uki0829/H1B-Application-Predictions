                <h3 class="text-accent" style="color: #B08C77;">Wage Impact on Approval Rates</h3>
                <p>
                    Applications with higher prevailing wages show significantly higher approval rates. Positions with salaries above the 75th percentile 
                    have an 85% approval rate, compared to 62% for those below the median wage. This suggests that higher-paid positions, 
                    which typically require more specialized skills, are prioritized in the visa approval process.

                <p>
                    H1B visa applications are heavily concentrated in a few states, with California, New York, Texas, New Jersey, and Illinois accounting 
                    for over 60% of all applications. This distribution closely mirrors tech industry hubs and financial centers, highlighting the 
                    relationship between industry concentration and demand for specialized foreign talent.

                <h3 class="text-accent" style="color: #B08C77;">Job Title Trends</h3>
                <p>
                    Software Engineers, Data Scientists, and IT Analysts represent the most common job titles in H1B applications. 
                    These technology-focused roles account for approximately 45% of all applications, reflecting the continued strong 
                    demand for tech talent that exceeds domestic supply.

                <h3 class="text-accent" style="color: #B08C77;">Full-Time vs. Part-Time</h3>
                <p>
                    Full-time positions receive significantly higher approval rates (79%) compared to part-time positions (58%). 
                    This disparity suggests that immigration authorities favor applications that demonstrate a more stable, 
                    long-term employment relationship and potentially greater economic contribution.
